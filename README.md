##MenuSystem
This project, MenuSystem, is a comprehensive menu management system for Minecraft servers. It provides a set of commands to create, list, delete menus and check the plugin version. The plugin is designed to be easy to use and highly customizable, allowing server administrators to create unique and engaging menus for their players. Although we are still in the initial phases, we are planning to implement more features in the future, such as a menu editor and more utilities.  Key Features:  
Create menus with the /menu-create "menuname" command.
List all available menus with the /menu-list command.
Delete menus with the /menu-delete "menuname" command.
Check the plugin version with the /menu-version command.
Installation and Usage:  
Download the MenuSystem jar file from the repository.
Place the jar file into the plugins folder of your Minecraft server.
Restart the server to load the plugin.
Use the provided commands to manage your menus.
