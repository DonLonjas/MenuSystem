## Project Description:

This project, MenuSystem, is a comprehensive menu management system for Minecraft servers. It provides a set of commands to create, list, delete menus and check the plugin version. The plugin is designed to be easy to use and highly customizable, allowing server administrators to create unique and engaging menus for their players. Although we are still in the initial phases, we are planning to implement more features in the future, such as a menu editor and more utilities.
